# Software.Architecture.Packages
# Rockae AI Package Catalogue

A comprehensive Django-based system for managing and evaluating AI packages and tools in the Rockae ecosystem. This platform helps developers discover, integrate, and track the performance of various AI-related packages.

## Features

- **AI Package Management**: Catalog and organize AI packages with detailed metadata
- **Categorization**: Classify packages by AI functionality (NLP, Computer Vision, Generation, etc.)
- **Integration Types**: Support for various integration methods (API, Library, Plugin)
- **Performance Tracking**: Store and monitor performance metrics for each package
- **Popularity Metrics**: Track package adoption and usage statistics
- **Model Compatibility**: Document supported AI models and versions

## System Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Django
- Database (SQLite by default, configurable)

## Package Model

The core `RockaePackageCatalogue` model includes:

- `name`: Package/tool name
- `description`: Detailed functionality description
- `repository_url`: Source code repository link

- `integration_type`: Integration method
- `supported_models`: Compatible AI models
- `popularity_score`: Usage popularity metric
- `performance_metrics`: Benchmarks and metrics data

## API Usage

The system provides RESTful APIs for package management:

- GET `/api/packages/`: List all packages
- POST `/api/packages/`: Register new package
- GET `/api/packages/<id>/`: Get package details
- PUT `/api/packages/<id>/`: Update package
- DELETE `/api/packages/<id>/`: Remove package

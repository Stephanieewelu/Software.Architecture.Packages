## Features

- **AI Package Management**: Catalog and organize AI packages with detailed metadata
- **Categorization**: Classify packages by AI functionality (NLP, Computer Vision, Generation, etc.)
- **Integration Types**: Support for various integration methods (API, Library, Plugin)
- **Performance Tracking**: Store and monitor performance metrics for each package
- **Popularity Metrics**: Track package adoption and usage statistics
- **Model Compatibility**: Document supported AI models and versions

## System Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Django
- Database (SQLite by default, configurable)
